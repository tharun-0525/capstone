# Notes:
#  - The current config results in all service being "changed" since that is what PR #10 represents (as specified in event.json)
#      PR #30 includes changes to all services
#      PR #10 contains changes to go + go-migrator (if you want to test the filtering)
#  - Uses catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04 because node:16-buster-slim doesnt contain git, and 24.04 image is still beta (and failed)
